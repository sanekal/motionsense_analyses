Analyses of motion sense dataset

This is a simple set of analyses on the MotionSense Dataset uploaded by M. Malekzadeh (https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/motion-sense). The dataset contains time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors by an iPhone 6s kept in the front pocket of 24 participants, who perform 6 different activities in 15 trials in the same environment under the same conditions.
